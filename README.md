# Time-Series-Renewable-energy-production-in-the-USA
1. Identification: Transform the time serie in a stationary serie if needed.
2. Analyze the ACF and PACF of the series to identify at least two possible models.
3. Estimate two of the identified models.
4. Carry out the complete Residue Analysis.
5. Get the long-term forecasts for the twelve months after the last observation, with the corresponding confidence intervals.
6. For the last model selected, applies automatic outlier detection. Interpretation of the atypical detected.

The project is further explained in the pdf/html/rmd.
